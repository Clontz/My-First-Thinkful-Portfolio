      <div id="about-content">
        <p>Ever since I was 3 years old, I have been working and playing with computers. I've always been fascinated by
          the vast capabilities of computers, the internet, and the software it utilizes. I took a class in high school,
          where I briefly learned how to code in C++, where we designed various functional programs and games. Once I
          got a taste of what being a software developer was like, I was hooked. After I graduated high school, I mainly
          focused on working in restaurants so I could learn how to properly work and collaborate with my team members.
          Now I can take that 10 years of experience in that field, and apply it to my dream career of being a software
          developer. I'm excited to work with other like-minded individuals, and develop some truly amazing software!
        </p>
        <p>
          Aside from software development, I also have some hobbies! My favorite hobbies are:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Discovering new and interesting places</li>
          <li>Riding my longboard</li>
          <li>Making music</li>
        </ol>
